              <h3 class="blog-content-title">Domino Effect</h3>
              <p>
                Birthday’s, Christmas, Anniversaries, Valentine’s Day… You name it.
                Gifting is a big part of our lives. According to Forbes, this industry is predicted to grow at a rate of 9.52% annually.
                Unity Marketing estimates that the total gifting market is more than $130 billion — with e-commerce retailers attracting the bulk of that spending.
                Nasdaq also reported that by the year 2040, as much as 95% of shopping will be facilitated by e-commerce.
                Wow! What could be the reason for this growth?
                Well, it could be the rising successful e-commerce industry for sure.
                However, from a psychological side, buying a well-thought gift makes the receiver feel good, as well as the buyer.
                This is what happens: Now the person knows better that you actually care for them and pay attention to their preferences, hence, they tend to like you more.
                And you love being liked by someone.
                You also love when people approve your choices.
                Voila, you feel good too.
              </p>

              <h3 class="blog-content-title">Two Birds, One Stone</h3>
              <p>
                What makes the gift market so powerful?
                What is their secret? Gift market is a unique marketing opportunity to touch two target consumers at once — the buyer making the purchase, and the lucky recipient.
                Gifting, in that sense, is an exponential marketing opportunity for retailers — because one gift purchase personally touches two people.
                We can imagine this as some sort of word-of-mouth marketing but delivered in a real-world way, through the gift.
                Retailers do need to pay a lot of attention to this — to bringing an astonishing gifting experience to both the buyer and the recipient.
                At the end of the day, that one transaction helps retailers build future brand loyalty with two customers.
              </p>

              <h3 class="blog-content-title">Canada's Favourites</h3>
              <p>
                Statista reports that as of January 2020, retail e-commerce sales value in Canada was 1.66bn CAD!
                In 2019, this amount was 25.4bn USD.
                And the most popular online shopping category goes to clothing/apparel.
                Unsurprisingly, amazon.ca was attributed the most popular online store in Canada.
                However, in the fashion segment, The Bay is always the market leader, generating 622,2 million USD via the sale of fashion articles in Canada.
                Gap Canada follows The Bay with revenue of 296,1 million USD.
                <br>
                We know that there is no competition with The Bay, at least for several decades.
                The reason being is that they provide amazing customer service in both online and offline shopping.
                Their website is very simple but fancy, and segregated into categories which are easy to spot.
                They have an amazing branding strategy, which makes them unique and indispensable, attracting people of all ages and genders.
                They also do a very good job being proudly Canadian by selling those famous Red Mittens and of course, their Canadian Olympic & Paralympic Team Collection under HB350.
                Shopping at The Bay is always a pleasure… Need I say more?
              </p>

              <h3 class="blog-content-title">What Now?</h3>
              <p>
                You may be tempted to ask what do all these data mean for the gifting industry.
                One thing we know is people will buy their gifts, especially during these uncertain times, online rather than in-store.
                According to Entrepreneur, 58% of people reported to shop online because of the ability to shop 24/7.
                This is a significant ratio.
                And what we know for certain is e-commerce sites that give better experience online will significantly do better and see extreme growth in the future.
              </p>
              <p>
                Is there a flaw in this ever-growing glamorous gifting industry?
                Well yes, everything has flaws.
                But this flaw might be more salient and exhausting than you think.
                How many hours do you spend on choosing gifts?
                Does e-commerce sites make this easier or not?
                Do you feel like there are too many options?
                Is it hard to get creative? I think we all know the answer.
              </p>
              <p>Stay tuned for the remedy.</p>

                Fathers… They were there when you were crying all night long.

                Here we go.
              </p>


              <h3 class="blog-content-title">Did you know...</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Father’s Day cards go way back. In fact, one of the earliest dates back roughly 4000 years! Elmesu, a Babylonian youngster, carved a card out of clay to “wish his father good health and long life.”
                  <span style="font-style: italic;">That’s cute.</span>

                <li>Father’s Day official flower is the rose! A red rose is worn in your lapel on Father’s Day if your father is living, and a white rose is worn if he has passed away.
                  <span style="font-style: italic;">Interesting.</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                  A necktie is a popular gift for Father’s Day.
                  And they date as far back as 221 B.C. When Chin Shi Huang, China’s first emperor, and his “terracotta army” were discovered, each replica was wearing a necktie.
                  Although, we know you want to be a little more creative with your gifts this year.
                  <span style="font-style: italic;">  And that’s why we are here :)</span>

            <h3 class="blog-content-title">Domino Effect</h3>
            <p>
              Birthday’s, Christmas, Anniversaries, Valentine’s Day… You name it.
              Gifting is a big part of our lives. According to Forbes, this industry is predicted to grow at a rate of 9.52% annually.
              Unity Marketing estimates that the total gifting market is more than $130 billion — with e-commerce retailers attracting the bulk of that spending.
              Nasdaq also reported that by the year 2040, as much as 95% of shopping will be facilitated by e-commerce.
              Wow! What could be the reason for this growth?
              Well, it could be the rising successful e-commerce industry for sure.
              However, from a psychological side, buying a well-thought gift makes the receiver feel good, as well as the buyer.
              This is what happens: Now the person knows better that you actually care for them and pay attention to their preferences, hence, they tend to like you more.
              And you love being liked by someone.
              You also love when people approve your choices.
              Voila, you feel good too.
            </p>

            <h3 class="blog-content-title">Two Birds, One Stone</h3>
            <p>
              What makes the gift market so powerful?
              What is their secret? Gift market is a unique marketing opportunity to touch two target consumers at once — the buyer making the purchase, and the lucky recipient.
              Gifting, in that sense, is an exponential marketing opportunity for retailers — because one gift purchase personally touches two people.
              We can imagine this as some sort of word-of-mouth marketing but delivered in a real-world way, through the gift.
              Retailers do need to pay a lot of attention to this — to bringing an astonishing gifting experience to both the buyer and the recipient.
              At the end of the day, that one transaction helps retailers build future brand loyalty with two customers.
            </p>

            <h3 class="blog-content-title">Canada's Favourites</h3>
            <p>
              Statista reports that as of January 2020, retail e-commerce sales value in Canada was 1.66bn CAD!
              In 2019, this amount was 25.4bn USD.
              And the most popular online shopping category goes to clothing/apparel.
              Unsurprisingly, amazon.ca was attributed the most popular online store in Canada.
              However, in the fashion segment, The Bay is always the market leader, generating 622,2 million USD via the sale of fashion articles in Canada.
              Gap Canada follows The Bay with revenue of 296,1 million USD.
              <br>
              We know that there is no competition with The Bay, at least for several decades.
              The reason being is that they provide amazing customer service in both online and offline shopping.
              Their website is very simple but fancy, and segregated into categories which are easy to spot.
              They have an amazing branding strategy, which makes them unique and indispensable, attracting people of all ages and genders.
              They also do a very good job being proudly Canadian by selling those famous Red Mittens and of course, their Canadian Olympic & Paralympic Team Collection under HB350.
              Shopping at The Bay is always a pleasure… Need I say more?
            </p>

            <h3 class="blog-content-title">What Now?</h3>
            <p>
              You may be tempted to ask what do all these data mean for the gifting industry.
              One thing we know is people will buy their gifts, especially during these uncertain times, online rather than in-store.
              According to Entrepreneur, 58% of people reported to shop online because of the ability to shop 24/7.
              This is a significant ratio.
              And what we know for certain is e-commerce sites that give better experience online will significantly do better and see extreme growth in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
              Is there a flaw in this ever-growing glamorous gifting industry?
              Well yes, everything has flaws.
              But this flaw might be more salient and exhausting than you think.
              How many hours do you spend on choosing gifts?
              Does e-commerce sites make this easier or not?
              Do you feel like there are too many options?
              Is it hard to get creative? I think we all know the answer.
            </p>
            <p>Stay tuned for the remedy.</p>

            <p>
              Fathers… They were there when you were crying all night long.
              They were there when you vomited in the middle of the kitchen.
              They were there in your most special moments.
              Now, it’s time for you to show how much you care for them too.
              All those years of guidance need to be properly celebrated.
            </p>

            <p>
              Father’s Day sure is a significant holiday where people are not afraid to spend $$.
              The National Retail Foundation reports that every year, Americans spend over $15 billion on Father’s Day gifts.
              This money is spent mostly on clothing ($2.2 billion), gift cards ($2.1 billion), and electronics (1.8 billion).
            </p>

            <h3 class="blog-content-title">The main takeaway from this “episode”</h3>

              Before coming to the end of our <strong>Father’s Day</strong> “episode”, feel free to enjoy some weird but cute facts about <strong>Father’s Day</strong>.
              Here we go.
            </p>

            <h3 class="blog-content-title">Did you know...</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Father’s Day cards go way back. In fact, one of the earliest dates back roughly 4000 years! Elmesu, a Babylonian youngster, carved a card out of clay to “wish his father good health and long life.”
                <span style="font-style: italic;">That’s cute.</span>
              </li>
              <li>Father’s Day official flower is the rose! A red rose is worn in your lapel on Father’s Day if your father is living, and a white rose is worn if he has passed away.
                <span style="font-style: italic;">Interesting.</span>
              </li>
              <li>
                A necktie is a popular gift for Father’s Day.
                And they date as far back as 221 B.C. When Chin Shi Huang, China’s first emperor, and his “terracotta army” were discovered, each replica was wearing a necktie.
                Although, we know you want to be a little more creative with your gifts this year.
                <span style="font-style: italic;">  And that’s why we are here :)</span>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              This is the <span style="font-style: italic">end</span> of the first "episode" of <span style="font-style: italic"> <strong>Donavi Specials.</strong> </span>
              See you soon!
